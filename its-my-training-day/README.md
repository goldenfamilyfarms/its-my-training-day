## 🗺️ Consolidation Information

This directory was created by consolidating overlapping content from:
- Root-level training directories
- adobe-dev training directories
- Additional unique materials from both locations

For detailed information about what was consolidated and how, see [CONSOLIDATION_MAP.md](./CONSOLIDATION_MAP.md).

## 🎯 How to Use This Repository
