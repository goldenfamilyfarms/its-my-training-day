# FastAPI - Concept Guide

## Overview

Deep dive into the FastAPI framework, covering its core features, patterns, and best practices. FastAPI has become a popular choice for Python APIs due to its performance, automatic documentation, and type safety.

## Prerequisites

- Python fundamentals (especially type hints and async/await)
- REST API design principles
- Basic understanding of Pydantic

## Recommended Study Order

1. **FastAPI Basics** - Project structure and routing
2. **Path & Query Parameters** - URL parameter handling
3. **Request Body & Pydantic** - Data validation and serialization
4. **Dependency Injection** - FastAPI's DI system
5. **Authentication & Security** - OAuth2, JWT patterns
6. **Middleware** - Request/response processing
7. **Background Tasks** - Async task handling
8. **Testing FastAPI Apps** - pytest patterns for APIs

## Interview Relevance

FastAPI-specific questions often appear in Python backend interviews:
- "How does FastAPI's dependency injection work?"
- "Explain how Pydantic validation integrates with FastAPI"
- "How would you structure a large FastAPI application?"
- "What are the performance benefits of FastAPI?"

Interviewers assess:
- Practical experience with modern Python frameworks
- Understanding of async programming in web contexts
- Knowledge of API security patterns
