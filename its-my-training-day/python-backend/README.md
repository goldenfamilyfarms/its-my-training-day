# Python Backend - Concept Guide

## Overview

This training track covers Python backend development topics commonly asked in technical interviews for backend engineers, automation engineers, and Python developers. Content ranges from core Python internals to API design, FastAPI specifics, microservices architecture, and live coding patterns.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python syntax and programming fundamentals
- Understanding of HTTP and REST concepts
- Familiarity with databases (SQL basics)

## Topics Covered

| Subdomain | Focus Area | Difficulty Range | Est. Time |
|-----------|------------|------------------|-----------|
| [fundamentals/](./fundamentals/) | Python internals, OOP, decorators, generators, async/await | Beginner - Advanced | 8 hours |
| [api-design/](./api-design/) | REST patterns, API versioning, error handling | Intermediate | 4 hours |
| [fastapi/](./fastapi/) | FastAPI framework, dependency injection, Pydantic | Intermediate - Advanced | 5 hours |
| [microservices/](./microservices/) | Service communication, patterns, deployment | Advanced | 6 hours |
| [live-coding/](./live-coding/) | Algorithm problems, data structures in Python | All levels | 10 hours |

## Recommended Study Order

1. **fundamentals/** - Start here to solidify Python core concepts
2. **api-design/** - Learn REST patterns and best practices
3. **fastapi/** - Deep dive into the FastAPI framework
4. **microservices/** - Understand distributed system patterns
5. **live-coding/** - Practice algorithm problems throughout

## Interview Relevance

Python backend topics appear in interviews for:
- **Backend Engineer**: API design, database integration, async programming
- **Automation Engineer**: Scripting, decorators, testing patterns
- **Platform Engineer**: Microservices, deployment, observability
- **Full Stack Developer**: FastAPI, REST APIs, data validation

Common interview formats:
- Technical deep-dives on Python internals (GIL, memory management)
- System design with Python service architecture
- Live coding with Python-specific optimizations
- Code review exercises focusing on Pythonic patterns
