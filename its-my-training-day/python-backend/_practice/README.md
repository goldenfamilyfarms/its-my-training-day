# Practice Exercises - Python Backend

## Overview

Hands-on coding exercises to reinforce concepts from the Python Backend training track. Each exercise includes a problem statement and a separate solution file for self-checking.

## How to Use

1. Read the problem file without looking at the solution
2. Implement your solution in your preferred environment
3. Compare against the reference solution
4. Note any differences in approach or optimization

## Exercises

| Exercise | Related Topic | Difficulty | Time Limit |
|----------|---------------|------------|------------|
| [LRU Cache](./lru-cache-problem.md) | Data Structures | Intermediate | 30 min |

## Exercise Format

Each exercise consists of two files:
- `{exercise-name}-problem.md` - Problem statement, requirements, optional hints
- `{exercise-name}-solution.md` - Reference solution with explanation

## Tips for Practice

- Set a timer to simulate interview conditions
- Talk through your approach before coding
- Consider edge cases before implementing
- Analyze time/space complexity of your solution
- Review the reference solution even if yours works

## Adding New Exercises

Use the templates in `_templates/` to create new exercises:
- `practice-problem-template.md`
- `practice-solution-template.md`
