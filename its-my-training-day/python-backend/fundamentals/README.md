# Fundamentals - Concept Guide

## Overview

Core Python concepts that form the foundation of backend development. These topics test your understanding of how Python works under the hood and your ability to write idiomatic, efficient code.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python syntax
- Understanding of functions and classes
- Familiarity with common data structures

## Recommended Study Order

1. **Decorators** - Essential for understanding frameworks and middleware
2. **Generators & Iterators** - Memory-efficient data processing
3. **Context Managers** - Resource management patterns
4. **Type Hints** - Modern Python best practices
5. **OOP Patterns** - Design patterns in Python
6. **Async/Await** - Asynchronous programming model
7. **GIL & Concurrency** - Understanding Python's threading model
8. **Memory Management** - Garbage collection and optimization
9. **Descriptors** - Advanced attribute access
10. **Metaclasses** - Class creation and customization

## Interview Relevance

Fundamentals questions appear in almost every Python interview:
- **Decorators**: "Implement a caching decorator" or "Explain how @property works"
- **Generators**: "What's the difference between a list and a generator?"
- **GIL**: "Can Python utilize multiple CPU cores? How?"
- **Async**: "When would you use asyncio vs threading vs multiprocessing?"

Interviewers use these topics to gauge:
- Depth of Python knowledge beyond basic syntax
- Understanding of performance implications
- Ability to write maintainable, Pythonic code
