# Live Coding - Concept Guide

## Overview

Algorithm and data structure problems commonly asked in Python technical interviews. This section focuses on Python-specific solutions, idioms, and optimizations that demonstrate mastery of the language.

## Prerequisites

- Python fundamentals
- Basic understanding of time/space complexity
- Familiarity with common data structures

## Recommended Study Order

1. **Arrays & Strings** - Foundation problems, Python list/string methods
2. **Hash Tables** - dict, set, Counter, defaultdict
3. **Two Pointers** - In-place array manipulation
4. **Sliding Window** - Substring/subarray problems
5. **Stacks & Queues** - deque, parsing problems
6. **Linked Lists** - Node manipulation, fast/slow pointers
7. **Sorting & Searching** - Built-in sort, binary search
8. **Trees & Graphs** - BFS, DFS, tree traversals
9. **Recursion & Backtracking** - Permutations, combinations
10. **Dynamic Programming** - Memoization, tabulation
11. **Python-Specific Tricks** - List comprehensions, generators, itertools

## Interview Relevance

Live coding is a core part of most technical interviews:
- **Phone Screens**: 1-2 medium problems in 45 minutes
- **Onsite**: Multiple rounds with increasing difficulty
- **Take-home**: Larger problems with clean code expectations

Python advantages in interviews:
- Concise syntax for faster implementation
- Rich standard library (collections, itertools, heapq)
- Easy to read and discuss with interviewer

Common patterns interviewers look for:
- Proper use of Python idioms
- Understanding of time/space complexity
- Clean, readable code structure
- Edge case handling
