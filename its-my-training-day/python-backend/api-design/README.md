## Recommended Study Order

1. **REST Principles** - Foundation of API design
2. **Resource Naming** - URL structure and conventions
3. **HTTP Methods & Status Codes** - Proper use of HTTP semantics
4. **Error Handling** - Consistent error responses
5. **API Versioning** - Managing API evolution
6. **Pagination & Filtering** - Handling large datasets
7. **Authentication Patterns** - Securing your APIs

## Interview Relevance

API design questions are common in backend interviews:
- "Design a REST API for a social media feed"
- "How would you handle API versioning?"
- "What status code would you return for X scenario?"
- "How do you implement pagination for large datasets?"

These topics demonstrate:
- Understanding of web standards and conventions
- Ability to design intuitive, developer-friendly APIs
- Knowledge of security and scalability concerns
