# Microservices - Concept Guide

## Overview

Microservices architecture patterns and practices for building distributed Python systems. These topics cover service communication, data management, and operational concerns in a microservices environment.

## Prerequisites

- Solid understanding of REST APIs
- Basic knowledge of message queues
- Familiarity with containerization (Docker)
- Understanding of database concepts

## Recommended Study Order

1. **Microservices Fundamentals** - When and why to use microservices
2. **Service Communication** - Sync vs async, REST vs gRPC
3. **API Gateway Patterns** - Routing, aggregation, authentication
4. **Event-Driven Architecture** - Message queues, pub/sub
5. **Circuit Breaker** - Handling service failures
6. **Saga Pattern** - Distributed transactions
7. **Service Discovery** - Dynamic service location
8. **Data Management** - Database per service, eventual consistency
9. **Containerization** - Docker, Kubernetes basics
10. **Observability** - Logging, tracing, metrics

## Interview Relevance

Microservices questions are common in senior backend and architect interviews:
- "How would you decompose a monolith into microservices?"
- "Explain the saga pattern for distributed transactions"
- "How do you handle service-to-service authentication?"
- "What are the tradeoffs of microservices vs monolith?"

These topics demonstrate:
- Experience with distributed systems
- Understanding of scalability and reliability patterns
- Knowledge of operational concerns
