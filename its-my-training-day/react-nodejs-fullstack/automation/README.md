# Automation - Concept Guide

## Overview

Testing, CI/CD, and build automation topics essential for senior full stack roles. Companies increasingly value engineers who can build reliable, well-tested systems with automated deployment pipelines.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of testing concepts
- Familiarity with Git workflows
- Command line proficiency

## Topics Covered

| Topic | Study Guide | Difficulty | Est. Time |
|-------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Unit Testing React | _Coming soon_ | Intermediate | 60 min |
| Integration Testing | _Coming soon_ | Intermediate | 60 min |
| E2E Testing with Playwright | _Coming soon_ | Intermediate | 75 min |
| CI/CD Pipelines | _Coming soon_ | Intermediate | 60 min |
| Build Optimization | _Coming soon_ | Advanced | 45 min |
| Test-Driven Development | _Coming soon_ | Intermediate | 60 min |

## Recommended Study Order

1. **Unit Testing React** - Testing components in isolation
2. **Test-Driven Development** - Writing tests first methodology
3. **Integration Testing** - Testing component interactions
4. **E2E Testing with Playwright** - Full user flow testing
5. **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automating test and deployment workflows
6. **Build Optimization** - Webpack, Vite, bundle analysis

## Interview Relevance

Automation skills demonstrate engineering maturity. Interviewers assess:

- Testing philosophy and strategy decisions
- Experience with testing libraries (Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright)
- CI/CD pipeline design and troubleshooting
- Build tool configuration and optimization

Common interview scenarios:
- "How would you test this component?"
- "Design a CI/CD pipeline for a React application"
- "How do you decide what to unit test vs integration test?"
