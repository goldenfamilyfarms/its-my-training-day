# Fundamentals - Concept Guide

## Overview

Core React and Node.js concepts that form the foundation of full stack development. These topics appear in nearly every technical interview and are essential for demonstrating senior-level understanding.

## Prerequisites

- JavaScript ES6+ syntax
- Basic React component structure
- Understanding of asynchronous programming

## Topics Covered

| Topic | Study Guide | Difficulty | Est. Time |
|-------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| React Hooks | [react-hooks-study-guide.md](./react-hooks-study-guide.md) | Intermediate | 90 min |
| State Management | _Coming soon_ | Intermediate | 60 min |
| Node.js Event Loop | _Coming soon_ | Advanced | 75 min |
| Async Patterns | _Coming soon_ | Intermediate | 60 min |
| Component Lifecycle | _Coming soon_ | Intermediate | 45 min |
| Performance Optimization | _Coming soon_ | Advanced | 60 min |

## Recommended Study Order

1. **React Hooks** - Foundation for modern React development
2. **Component Lifecycle** - Understanding when and why components update
3. **State Management** - Local vs global state, when to use each
4. **Async Patterns** - Promises, async/await, error handling
5. **Node.js Event Loop** - Critical for understanding Node.js behavior
6. **Performance Optimization** - Memoization, lazy loading, profiling

## Interview Relevance

Fundamentals questions are used to gauge baseline competency. Senior candidates are expected to:

- Explain hooks beyond basic usage (custom hooks, rules of hooks)
- Discuss state management trade-offs (Context vs Redux vs Zustand)
- Articulate the Node.js event loop phases
- Demonstrate understanding of React's reconciliation algorithm

Common interview formats:
- Whiteboard coding with hooks
- System design discussions involving state management
- Debugging scenarios related to async behavior

## Total Estimated Time: 8 hours
