# Practice Exercises - React/Node.js Full Stack

## Overview

Hands-on exercises to validate your understanding of React and Node.js concepts. Each exercise provides a problem statement without the solution visible, allowing you to practice recreating concepts independently.

## How to Use

1. Read the problem file thoroughly
2. Attempt the solution without looking at hints
3. If stuck, use the progressive hints
4. Compare your solution with the reference solution
5. Note any gaps in your understanding for review

## Tips for Practice

- Set a timer to simulate interview conditions
- Talk through your approach out loud (practice for whiteboard interviews)
- Focus on correctness first, then optimization
- Review the solution even if you solved it—there may be alternative approaches
