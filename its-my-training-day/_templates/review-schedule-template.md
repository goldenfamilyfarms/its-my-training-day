# Review Schedule: Spaced Repetition Tracker

## Overview

This template helps you track your study progress using spaced repetition intervals. The recommended intervals are based on the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve: **1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days**.

## How to Use

1. After completing a study guide, add it to the appropriate track section below
2. Record the completion date in the "Completed" column
3. Calculate and fill in the review dates based on the intervals
4. Check off each review as you complete it
5. After the 30-day review, the topic moves to "Mastered" status

## Interval Recommendations

| Review # | Interval | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 1st | 1 day | Immediate reinforcement |
| 2nd | 3 days | Short-term retention |
| 3rd | 7 days | Medium-term consolidation |
| 4th | 14 days | Long-term memory formation |
| 5th | 30 days | Mastery verification |

Record your review sessions and any notes:

| Date | Topic | Review # | Confidence (1-5) | Notes |

| | | | | |

### Confidence Scale
- **1**: Struggled significantly, need to re-study
- **2**: Remembered with difficulty, schedule extra review
- **3**: Adequate recall, continue normal schedule
- **4**: Good recall, confident in understanding
- **5**: Excellent recall, consider extending intervals

## Tips for Effective Spaced Repetition

1. **Be consistent**: Review at the scheduled times, even if briefly
2. **Active recall**: Try to answer before looking at the solution
3. **Adjust intervals**: If struggling, reset to Day 1; if easy, extend intervals
4. **Use Anki**: Import generated .apkg files for automated scheduling
5. **Review before bed**: Memory consolidation happens during sleep
