# Practice Exercises - System Design & Architecture

## Overview

Hands-on system design exercises to validate your understanding of distributed systems concepts. Each exercise includes constraints, requirements, and a reference solution with architecture diagrams.

## How to Use

1. Read the problem statement and constraints
2. Set a timer (typically 45-60 minutes)
3. Design your solution on paper or whiteboard
4. Compare against the reference solution
5. Note areas for improvement

## Exercise Format

Each exercise includes:
- **Problem file**: Requirements, constraints, and hints
- **Solution file**: Reference architecture with diagrams and trade-off analysis

## Available Exercises

| Exercise | Difficulty | Focus Area | Est. Time |
|----------|------------|------------|-----------|
| [URL Shortener](./url-shortener-problem.md) | Intermediate | Distributed Systems, Caching | 45 min |

## Recommended Practice Schedule

1. **Week 1-2**: Focus on fundamentals exercises
2. **Week 3-4**: Move to domain-specific designs
3. **Week 5+**: Practice full interview simulations

## Tips for Effective Practice

- **Time yourself**: Real interviews have strict time limits
- **Talk out loud**: Practice explaining your thinking
- **Draw diagrams**: Visual communication is essential
- **Consider trade-offs**: There's no perfect solution
- **Iterate**: Start simple, then add complexity

## Self-Evaluation Rubric

After each exercise, rate yourself on:

| Criteria | Score (1-5) |
|----------|-------------|
| Requirements gathering | |
| Estimation accuracy | |
| Component selection | |
| Data model design | |
| Trade-off analysis | |
| Communication clarity | |
