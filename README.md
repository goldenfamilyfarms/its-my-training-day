## Running the Code

Each implementation file is self-contained and can be used as reference. To run:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. TypeScript files can be compiled:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

3. React components can be used in a React application with appropriate setup.

## Interview Preparation Tips

1. **Understand the Problem First** - Each answer demonstrates requirements gathering
2. **Architectural Thinking** - Solutions show scalability and maintainability considerations
3. **Performance Awareness** - Optimizations are explained with trade-offs
4. **Production Readiness** - Error handling, monitoring, and observability included
5. **Compliance Context** - Solutions consider audit requirements and data integrity

## Notes

- Code implementations are production-ready examples
- Some implementations use simplified versions of external services (e.g., in-memory stores instead of databases)
- Real implementations would integrate with actual cloud provider SDKs, databases, and message queues
- All code follows TypeScript best practices and includes comprehensive type safety

## Questions Without Code

Some questions in the original markdown file are process/strategy questions that don't require code implementations. These are documented in the markdown file but don't have corresponding code files.

## Contributing

This is a preparation repository. If you find improvements or have additional questions to add, feel free to extend the structure.
